### Web Scraper Program
This is a Python program designed to scrape data from a website. It uses the Beautiful Soup library to parse the HTML of the website and extract the relevant data.

### Installation
Before running the program, you'll need to install the required libraries. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
  pip install requests
  pip install beautifulsoup4
```

### Usage
To use the program, simply run the main.py file in your Python environment. The program will prompt you for the URL of the website you want to scrape and the name of the file you want to save the data to.

Once you've entered the required information, the program will scrape the website and save the data to a CSV file with the name you provided.

### Limitations
It's important to note that web scraping can be a legally gray area, and some websites have specific policies against scraping their data. Be sure to read and understand the website's terms of service before using this program.

Additionally, some websites may use techniques to prevent scraping, such as CAPTCHAs or IP blocking. This program does not include any measures to circumvent these techniques, so it may not work on all websites.
